https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/description/
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), 
and its complement is 010. 
So you need to output 2.
