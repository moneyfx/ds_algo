How to convert decimal to binary

1- Divide the number by 2.
2- Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
3- Get the remainder for the hex digit.
4- Repeat the steps until the quotient is equal to 0.

Convert 13 to binary:
Division by 2    Quotient    Remainder   Bit #
    13/2            6           1           0
    6/2             3           0           1
    3/2             1           1           2
    1/2             0           1           3
So 13(in base 10) = 1101(in base 2)
